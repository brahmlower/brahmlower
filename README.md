
## Heya, I'm Brahm! 👋

I'm a software engineer with a focus on backend services and systems design. I prefer brevity, explicitness and self discovery in my tools, and have consequently grown to love Rust, Go, HTMX, and Tailwind, among a myriad of other daily utilities. My repos here on github are typically experiments or incomplete side-projects, but do sometimes include real usable projects.

### Personal Portfolio

Proper tools:

- [helm-values](https://github.com/brahmlower/helm-values) a helm plugin for generating values file schema & docs

Rust crates:

- [default_aware](https://crates.io/crates/default_aware) a crate for better handling default values created through deserialization
- [prefixed-api-key](https://crates.io/crates/prefixed-api-key) a crate for generating [seam style](https://github.com/seamapi/prefixed-api-key) api tokens
- [Airbrake Rust](https://github.com/kyrylo/airbrake-rust) (inactive) rust crate for airbrake telemetry

Web services:
- [Today I Learned](https://til.brahmlower.io/) (serverless- give it a sec to cold-start)
- [Connect Snake](https://blog.brahmlower.io/connect-snake-game/)

Old but cool projects:
- [Status-Page Monitor](https://github.com/brahmlower/statuspage-monitor) (inactive) mac app for watching the status page of select services
- [Postgres Virtual Tables](https://github.com/brahmlower/postgres-virtual-tables)
- [pgzan](https://github.com/brahmlower/pgzan) postgres extension for evaluating zanzibar policies within row level security

### Work Portfolio

My professional work is typically closed source but a few projects I can proudly share are:

- 2025: Major redesign of the authentication system at Censys (https://accounts.censys.io/)
- 2021: [OneLogin Smart Hooks](https://developers.onelogin.com/api-docs/2/smart-hooks/overview)
  An extensible hook system enabling customers to added their own custom behavior to events and flows within existing OneLogin products/features

### Brief Philosophies

- I [grug brain](https://grugbrain.dev/)
- [Psychological safety](https://friday.app/p/what-is-psychological-safety) & [managing up](https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/managing-up-importance) are keystones to an effective organization
- Suburbs aren't a culture. We need walkable cities & good public transit
- Touch grass 🌱
